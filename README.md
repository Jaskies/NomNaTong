This is the repository for the "Nom Na Tong" font. 
The Nom Na Tong font was originally developed under the aegis of the Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation
<http://www.nomfoundation.org>, established in 1999.
The font was developed both as a definitive source for proposals to encode the Vietnamese Hán-Nôm script in Unicode and
to promote access to the heritage of works written in that script.
The font currently contains over 26,000 glyphs, and represents the collective work of scholars, software engineers,
and other experts. It continues to be the reference font for the continue work of encoding Hán-Nôm in Unicode.
The foundation dissolved at the end of 2018. Now the font is being provided as an open source project in the hope that
a community of those interested in the preservation of the Hán-Nôm script will continue to maintain and extend it.
